\usage{
mlflow_log_artifact(path, artifact_path = NULL)
}

\item{artifact_path}{Destination path within the runâ€™s artifact URI.}
}
\description{
Logs an specific file or directory as an artifact.
}
\details{
The fluent API family of functions operate with an implied MLflow client
  determined by the service set by `mlflow_set_tracking_uri()`. For operations
  involving a run it adopts the current active run, or, if one does not exist,
  starts one through the implied service.

When logging to Amazon S3, ensure that the user has a proper policy
attach to it, for instance:

\code{
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
  {
    "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "s3:PutObject",
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:ListBucket",
      "s3:GetBucketLocation"
      ],
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:s3:::mlflow-test/*",
      "arn:aws:s3:::mlflow-test"
      ]
  }
  ]
}
}

Additionally, at least the \code{AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} and \code{AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}
environment variables must be set to the corresponding key and secrets provided
by Amazon IAM.
