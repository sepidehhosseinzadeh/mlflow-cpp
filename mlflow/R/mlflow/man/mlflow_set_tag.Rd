\usage{
mlflow_set_tag(key, value)
}
\arguments{

\item{value}{String value of the tag being logged. Maximum size is 500 bytes. This field is required.}
}
\description{
Set a tag on a run. Tags are run metadata that can be updated during and
 after a run completes.
}
\details{
The fluent API family of functions operate with an implied MLflow client
  determined by the service set by `mlflow_set_tracking_uri()`. For operations
  involving a run it adopts the current active run, or, if one does not exist,
  starts one through the implied service.
